Andy Getting Feedback

Throughout your Nanodegree program, you will submit your work at 5 stages for review. You will see each of these in your Nanodegree portal. When you submit your work at these stages, you will receive a grade that indicates either that you've passed that stage, or that you need to work on your project and resubmit again. 

To give you an early opportunity to experience the submission process and get feedback immediately after you put your newest skills into practice, please submit your work thus far. You'll see this indicated on the portal as Stage 0: Getting Started with HTML. 

Details:
•You will not receive a grade for your Stage 0 submission (but you will receive feedback)
•We want you to submit your notes from the first lesson within one week of beginning the Nanodegree, but there will not be any consequences for missing this deadline. 
•Future stages (Stage 1 - Stage 5) must be completed on time.
•This is a formative checkpoint designed to give you immediate feedback and ensure you have the confidence and the support you need to keep moving forward. 

Next: Follow the instructions on the next two slides to submit Stage 0.
